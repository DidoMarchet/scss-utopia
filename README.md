:waning_crescent_moon: Css (Scss) is not an exact science and manage easily fluid, responsive and static styles in perfect harmony with designer's vision (IMHO) is utopia. 

:waning_gibbous_moon: Is for that purpose [scss-utopia](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scss-utopia) was created: cover **most developer needs** in the simplest and automated way!

### The idea
My biggest worry when I start to write styling component is create a set of classes to establish guidelines around how our typography, spacing and sizes should behave across the application. 

:heart: I always loved have the right class for the right head.

:broken_heart: but reality is a mess. Headings with promiscuous behavior: fluids after a certain breakpoint, static between other breakpoints and fluid again (It's not a joke).
